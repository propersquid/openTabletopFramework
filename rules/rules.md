# Terms

- **Story teller**: The person in charge of guiding the story. The world that
  they present may be a world that they have built, or are running a 3rd party
  campaign.
- **Player**: Someone playing a character in the world.
- **Agent**: An in world character. This could be a player character, non-player
  character (played by the story teller), or etc.
- **Trait**: A trait is an attribute that is given to an agent that affects an
  aspect about them. See [Traits](#traits) for more information.
- **Trait Effect**: An effect that is given by a trait. See [Traits](#traits)
  for more information.
- **`x`d`y`**: The dice to roll. `x` is the number of dice, `y` is the number of
  sides.

# Basic Rules

1. Be kind. Everyone is participating to have fun. There are some things that
   may be extremely uncomfortable for people. Just because your character is an
   evil and horrible creature doesn't mean you can be.
2. The story teller is always right. It is assumed that everyone is reasonable,
   and the players, story teller, etc are here to work together to create a fun
   environment for everyone. If this assumption is invalidated, then this system
   has no solution, and is left up to the individual members how they want to
   resolve the issues. If there are any dispute about mechanics, plot holes,
   etc, then the story teller has final say.
3. Role play everything. This system is about creating stories and characters.
   Players should be rewarded for doing something that their character would
   likely do (unless it goes against rule 1).
4. The base rules can be modified at any time, but the story teller has to
   accept the modification.
5. These rules guide the general structure of the game. There can be campaign
   specific rules that can override these rules.

# Challenged Action

A challenged action is when an agent performs an action that is challenged by
another agent, environment, etc. For example, classic combat, haggling prices,
picking a lock, etc.

When a challenge action occurs, then the participants (agents and/or environment
(via the story teller)) must sum up the trait effects that are related
(challenge action score). This must include effects that are positive and
negative, unless there's a story explanation why an effect must be excluded.
Then, if the challenge action score for one participant is greater than the
challenge action score + 20 of another participant, then the challenge is
automatically awarded to the participant with the higher score (no contest
test). After the no contest test, each participant will roll a 1d20 to add to
their challenge action score, then test against the other participants. The
participant with the higher score will then win the challenge (contest test). If
there is a tie during the no contest test or the contest test, then the defender
will win or nothing will happen.

## Modifier Tables

Challenge action scores can be modified based on a few aspects such as distance,
number of targets, speed, etc. The table can be modified for each campaign
(including adding or removing tables). The tables represent things that will
make the task more challenging, but also have a positive effect. For example,
freezing someone by touching them vs casting a cold spray and freezing multiple
targets at a distance.

## Turns

The turn order describes the order of when participants can perform actions. It
is calculated by summing up trait effects that could increase or decrease the
speed of the actions being performed (for example, highly dexterous agents in
light armour would likely be faster than slower agents in heavy armour). Then,
each participant will roll 1d20 to add to their sum. After that, each particpant
will take turns performing actions in the order of highest sum to lowest. If
there are any ties, then they can be broken by re-rolling the 1d20.

## Action

Players can have multiple actions per turn, depending on the speed of their
effect. An action is used regardless of whether the player succeeds or not. The
actions per turn table is based off of the [Speed Chart](#speed-table).

## Success Range

When performing a no contest or contest test, the difference between the
challenge action scores will dictate how successful the participant is. The
campaign may define multiple tables based on the type of action being performed,
but if none is provided, then the following formula should be used:

Add the challenge effect score (including rerolled dice) for every 5 challenge
action score difference value

## Challenge Effects

When a challenge is won, then an effect is applied to the winning and/or losing
participants. The winning participants should gain a positive effect, while the
losing participants should gain a negative effect. The effects and magnitude of
the effects are calculated by summing up all of the related positive and
negative trait effects (unless there's a story explanation as to why a trait
cannot be added) to get the challenge effects score. Then 1d6 is added to the
score. If any dice have the value six, then they are re-rolled, and added to the
value until no more sixes are rolled.

# Traits

Traits are the main way to describe an entity such as an agent, environment,
etc. They can be a part of the entity (for example, their physical strength,
knowledge, etc), their inventory (weapons, armour, etc), or due to any other
aspect of the entity. If the traits support it, then they can be stacked to
increase or decrease trait effects, applied or removed unless a condition
prevents them (for example, an agent's physical strength cannot be removed
unless they have not exercised, or an item cannot be removed due to a curse).
Traits can be added at any time if certain conditions are met (for example,
increased strength when levelling up, go mad from learning forbidden knowledge,
equipping or removing weapons or armour.) Traits are passive, but can be
activated for a powerful effect. After the duration has expired (whether a time
limit such as instantly, over the next 5 turns, or when the player reaches max
health), then the trait is burnt, and the burnt passive effects (but not the
regular passive effects) are applied until the reset condition is met.

## Trait Rating

Each trait is rated based on how beneficial or detrimental the card is. At
character creation, each player can be given a maximum rating and/or a maximum
trait count that they can have to start with.

# Running a Campaign

## Character Creation

Each character creation session will be different from campaign to campaign. It
is recommended to pick a maximum trait rating (such as 10) and a maximum number
of traits (such as 10) that a player can use. Then provide them a list of traits
and scores for them to build their character.

## Levelling Up

There are multiple ways to handle levelling up a player character to make them
more powerful. This includes certain story events where it makes sense for the
character to improve, tracking their experience and increasing their level after
a certain amount of points, etc. But, the suggested way to level up is to set a
new total maximum trait rating (and possibly allow players to add/remove
traits), or allow the players increase their maximum trait rating by a value
(and possibly allow them to add/remove traits). But, it is up to the campaign
and story teller.

## Example Scenarios

### Bill and Ted get into a fight

Bill (a bounty hunter) finds Ted (an outlaw with a bounty on his head) in an old
abandoned mine. Bill decides to hide from Ted and find a favourable vantage
point to shoot him. This is a challenged action because Bill is trying to hide
from Ted. Bill's traits allow him to have a challenged action score of 10. Ted
is normally very alert, and would have a challenged action score of 30. If this
were the case, then Ted would win the challenge with a no contest. But, Ted has
been celebrating a large haul, and is currently sleeping off way too much
alcohol. This means that his challenge action score is 5. Since the no-contest
test fails (the difference of 10 - 5 is 5, which is less than 20), Bill and Ted
roll 1d20 each. Bill rolls a 12, and Ted rolls a 3. Therefore, Bill's final
challenge action score is 22, and Ted's score is 8. Bill wins the challenge, and
the effect of his stealth is calculated.

The story teller decides that Bill needs to calculate how effective Bill's
sneaking is by rolling the 1d6 only. The more effective, the better Bill can be
positioned, and gain an attack bonus. The challenged action score difference
(Bill's 22 to Ted's 8) is 14. This means that Bill can re-roll his dice twice
(re-roll every 5 points). Bill's final score with dice allows him to find a spot
where he has a clear shot while keeping him very well hidden.

Bill decides to take the shot, and performs another challenged action against
Ted. But, Ted decides to activate one of his traits called "Slippery Fish" and
allows him to dodge the bullet and escape from Bill.
