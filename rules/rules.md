Basic Rules
===========
1. The game master is always right
2. Role play everything
3. The base rules can be modified at any time, but the game master has to make the modification.
4. The game master must make a set of rules for the campaign. (These rules do not cover things like magic, guns, or cthulhu.)
5. Nothing is official until written down.

Combat
======
Combat is anything where the player exerts their will on someone else. For example, fighting, bartering, mind control. If a player is fighting another player or non-playable character (including monsters), then they will roll their chance dice. Whoever rolls the highest dice (after modifiers) wins the “dice battle”. In the case of a tie, the defender wins the dice battle.

Health
------
Players start off with ten health. Once they reach zero, they will be unconscious, and bleed one health per turn until they reach negative five health. After that, they are dead. Also, any attacks that send the health to zero cannot make the health go lower. Any attacks after the player's health is zero or under will cause damage to the player.

Turns
-----
Turns are based off of a percentile dice roll plus modifiers. The player order is sorted from highest to lowest.

Action
------
Players can have multiple actions per turn, depending on the speed of their effect. An action is used regardless of whether the player succeeds or not. The actions per turn table is based off of the following chart:

| Speed     | Actions |
| :-------- | :------ |
| Very Fast | 5       |
| Fast      | 4       |
| Medium    | 3       |
| Slow      | 2       |
| Very Slow | 1       |

Dice
====

Chance Dice
-----------
Chance Dice is the chance to successfully complete an action in combat. The dice used is a percentile dice, and by default, every action has a 1/10 chance of succeeding. To make a critical success, you have to roll the success number or lower. Critical fail is the fail number or higher. The critical success and fail is based off the following chart:

| Percent | Critical Success | Critical Fail |
| :------ | :--------------- | :------------ |
| 10      | 1                | 91            |
| 20      | 2                | 92            |
| 30      | 3                | 93            |
| 40      | 4                | 94            |
| 50      | 5                | 95            |
| 60      | 6                | 96            |
| 70      | 7                | 97            |
| 80      | 8                | 98            |
| 90      | 9                | 99            |
| 100     | 10               | 100           |

> **Example:** With a 20% chance to hit, rolling a 2 or a 1 would be a critical success, and rolling a 92-100 is a critical failure.
The chance dice can be modified through active or passive cards the player has in their possession.

Effect Dice
-----------
The effect dice says how effective the player action is. The dice chosen depends on the linear range of the effect (eg: an arrow being fired out of a bow), the radial range of the effect (eg: an explosion), the speed of the effect (eg: a bullet vs a rock being thrown), and the duration of the effect (eg: being drunk). The effects can be added together, but by doing so, the effectiveness of the action will suffer. The effect dice are based off of the following charts:

| Speed     | Dice Sides |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| Very Fast | 4          |
| Fast      | 6          |
| Medium    | 8          |
| Slow      | 10         |
| Very Slow | 12         |

| Linear Range | Modifier |
| :----------- | :------- |
| Very Far     | -4       |
| Far          | -3       |
| Medium       | -2       |
| Close        | -1       |
| Very Close   | 0        |

| Radial Range | Modifier |
| :----------- | :------- |
| Very Far     | -4       |
| Far          | -3       |
| Medium       | -2       |
| Close        | -1       |
| Very Close   | 0        |

| Duration   | Modifier |
| :--------- | :------- |
| Very Long  | -4       |
| Long       | -3       |
| Medium     | -2       |
| Short      | -1       |
| Very Short | 0        |

> **Example:** A very slow very close attack, with very low radius and very short duration will do a maximum of 12 damage. A very fast very far attack with a very high radius and very long duration will do a maximum of 0 damage, unless the player rolls a critical success, and continues to roll 4 on the 4 sided dice until the damage adds up to 8 or higher.

> If the player manages to roll a critical success, then if there are any dice that rolled their maximum side (eg: 6 on a 6 sided die), then add up the dice, and reroll the maximum dice and add their values until there are no more dice to add.

Cards
=====
Cards are the main source of describing the characters and items in the game. The majority of the campaign rules should be created in the cards.

Positions
---------
A card can be in several positions. Each position dictates where the item is in the world.

### Deck
If the card is in the deck, then it is in the world. Getting a card from the deck means the character has gained a skill (ability card), or gained an item (item card).

### Hand
If the card is in the player’s hand, then it is in their backpack. If the player wishes to take the card from their backpack, then they will need to spend a turn pulling the item from their backpack. If the player wishes to put an item in their backpack, then they’ll need to spend a turn putting it in their backpack.

> **Note:** This only applies to item cards.

### Field
If the card is in front of the player, then it is on the field. Cards on the field are the ability cards that describe the character, or item cards that are on the character, in the character’s hands, or otherwise in quick access for the character.

Ability Cards
=============
Ability cards define what the character is. Anything such as weapon proficiency, natural defenses, martial arts skills, phobias, etc are defined in the cards. All cards have a positive and/or negative rating based off of the passive effect of the card. This rating is based off of how beneficial the card is to the player. All ability cards must be on the field, unless the game master lets the player hide the card. The card is still treated as on the field.

Stacking
--------
Stacking is when the player has more than one card in their possession. All cards can stack, unless stated by the card. Active cards that are stacked will allow the player to use the active ability multiple times until the cards are used up, and passive stacked cards will multiply the effects of the card. In cases where it does not make sense to multiply an effect, other effects will be added based on the game master's discretion.

Out of Turn
-----------
Out of turn effects can be played at any time, unless there is a restriction in place at the time. Cards that state that they can be played out of turn can only be played out of turn.

Passive
-------
Passive abilities are in the player’s possession and activated indefinitely unless there’s a case in the game that requires them to remove the card. Passive effects can be beneficial to the player, or detrimental. Also, the sum of the card ratings can be no more than a card rating limit dictated by the game master.

Active
------
Active abilities can be used by the player in their turn (or out of turn if the card supports it), and must be flipped after use. The player cannot use the card (active or passive) until they rest, or a card lets them gain the ability back.

Creation
--------
Cards should be created for the campaign to add to the story and give rules to the world and people. Every card has to be both passive and active, and passive effects must have ratings. Ratings for the cards should be relative to how beneficial the card is to the player in most cases. For example: If a card adds bonus damage to the undead, and undead is rare in the game, then the rating should be lower than a more general card with the same effect.

Item Cards
==========
Item cards are cards such as armour, weapons, potions, explosives, etc. Item cards that are in a player’s hand are in their backpack. The player will need to spend a turn to pull the item out of their backpack.
